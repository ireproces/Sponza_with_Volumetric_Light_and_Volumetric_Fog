# Unity Volumetric Lighting & Fog Demo
Exam project submitted for the **Computer Graphics course**, academic year **2024-2025**.

## Overview

This project was developed using the Unity game engine.

As a base environment, the pre-existing **Sponza** asset was integrated and used as a reference scene for experimentation. Within this setting, custom logic was implemented to manage lighting and volumetric fog effects, with the goal of recreating a dense and atmospheric environment.

The project made it possible to observe and evaluate the interactions between light beams and the simulated fog, assessing both the visual impact and the effectiveness of the resulting graphical rendering.

## Technologies Used

- Unity (version 6.0)
- Sponza Scene (3D asset)
- Custom C# scripts
- Unity's Built-in

## Features

- 💡 Real-time lighting with dynamic light sources
- 🌫️ Volumetric fog simulation
- 🎮 Interactive 3D environment based on the Sponza atrium
- ✅ Visual tests for lighting and fog interaction
